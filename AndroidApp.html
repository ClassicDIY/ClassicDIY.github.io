The Classic Monitor Android app displays information from your classic charge controller. Your charge controller must be connected and configured to your local network, please refer to the classic charge controller documentation provided by Midnite Solar. Your Android device must also be connected to the same local network.

With port forwarding and a DDNS service, the classic monitor can connect to your controller over the internet by adding a connection using the domain name provided by your ddns service and the public port number configured in your router. A free DDNS service is available from www.noip.com, your router must support the DDNS service you select.

This app currently supports the Classic & Classic Lite models 150, 200, 250 charge controllers, the Classic SL series is not supported since it does not have a network connection, basic support for the TriStar MPPT charge controllers is also included.

The app displays a different set of tabs depending on your configuration;
